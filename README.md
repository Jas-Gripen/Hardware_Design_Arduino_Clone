# Hardware_Design_Arduino_Clone
I made schematics for an Arduino Clone in KiCad.
There is a description of why I chosed to design the board like I did in the PCB_Report.pdf file.

The original schematic (only Eeschema type) are avalible here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Main/arduino_NG_schematic.png
The placement of the components as well as the version of them are of my own choosing. The same goas for the PCB-traces and vias.
